# JS Retro Shooter

> This project is a game inspired by the game "[ASTRO WARRIORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Warrior/)" by SEGA. This game is built with JS ES6 and Phaser3.

## Features

1. The player can navigate to the following scenes after the game loads
1.1. `Credits`: This is where we give credits to the ASTRO WARRIOR and the creator of the game.
1.2. `The Top`: The scene where top 5 players are displayed.
1.3. `Play`: We navigate the guide scene and understand how to play the game before proceeding.
2. A player can fire a laser to kill the enemy attacking.
3. The enemy can also fire laser and kill the player.
3. After the game is over, the player has the option to `restart` game and `submit` score by pressing `ENTER`.

## Future Feature (v2.02)

1. Improve the UI
2. Add levels to the game
3. Each level should have a more attacking enemies and different types of them.
